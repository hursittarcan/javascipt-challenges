# CHALLENGE FIVE
Mohammad loves sorting out numbers. He's preparing to join the number sorting championship. His task is the following:     
* He get's a piece of paper with 50 random numbers on it.           
* He needs to sort them from lowest to highest.         
* He only has one minute.      

He wants us to make a console application that checks his solution. 

Example input:     
`let numbersToSort = [1, 5, 50, 15, 4, 10, 6, 7, 9, 2];`      

Example output:     
`1,2,4,5,6,7,9,10,15,50`
