# CHALLENGE THREE
We have to create a simple `insurance price calculator` for Tarcan's Car Ensurance. They want us to make a `console application`, which `calculates` a `total price` based on `two input values` (age and car power). There are `four input values` in `total`: 
* User name
* User age 
* Car brand
* Motor power

Example input:     
`let ownerName = "Hursit Tarcan";`     
`let ownerAge = 20;`      
`let carBrand = "BMW"`     
`let motorPower = 250;`     

Example output:     
`User: Hursit Tarcan`      
`Car: BMW`      
`Total amount to pay: €1000`       

Here are the `requirements`:        
* The `fixed price` for every case is: `€500`. 
* If a `user` is `24 years (or older)` he needs to pay `€100` on to of the fixed price. If he is `younger` he pays `€200`. 
* If the `car` has `more than 150 hp`, the user needs to pay an extra `€300`, `else` he pays `€100`.  

**Try using a `conditional (ternary) operator` instead of the classic if-else.**
