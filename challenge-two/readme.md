# CHALLENGE TWO
Karen is a teacher and she wants a simple console application to help her with managing scores. She wants us to create an app that accepts `one single array` (with an undefiend length) and returns: 
* The highest score of the test
* The lowest score of the test 
* The average score of the test

Example input:     
`let scores = [8, 2, 7, 9, 6, 6, 4, 2, 3, 8, 10, 10, 5, 0, 4, 6]`      

Example output:     
`"The highest score for this test is: 10"`      
`"The lowest score for this test is: 0"`      
`"The average score for this test is: 6"`
